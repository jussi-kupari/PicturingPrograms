; Exercise 14.1.8
; Modify the animation of Exercise 8.3.1 or 8.3.2 so that
; the animation ends when the circle is wider or taller than
; the window. Hint: Recall that in these animations, the model
; was a number representing radius. The diameter is twice the
; radius. Be sure to test the program with a window thatâ€™s wider
; than it is tall, or taller than it is wide.


; Practice Exercise 8.3.1
; Recall that for the animation of Exercise 8.2.1, we decided that the model is a number
; indicating the radius of the circle. How would we change the radius? Well, if we wanted
; the circle to grow over time, we could add 1 to the radius at each clock tick.
; 
; Try this.
; 
; Exercise 8.3.2
; Modify the display of Exercise 8.3.1 so that the circle appears centered
; and unmoving in a 200x200 white background, so it appears to grow around a fixed center.
