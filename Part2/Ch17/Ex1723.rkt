; Exercise 17.2.3
; Write an animation like that of Exercise 8.5.3, but coloring each dot
; either red, green, or blue, at random.
; Hint: Try writing a helper function that returns one of the three color names at random.


; Exercise 8.5.3
; Write an animation that starts with a blank screen, and each half
; second adds a small dot at a completely random location â€” both the x coordinate and the
; y coordinate are chosen at random.
