; Exercise 15.5.4
; Three candidates (Anne, Bob, and Charlie) are running for mayor of
; Racketville, which, by court order, has a new computerized voting
; system. Develop a function named who-won that takes in three numbers
; (the number of votes for Anne, the number of votes for Bob, and the
; number of votes for Charlie, respectively) and returns a string
; indicating who won â€“ either "Anne", "Bob", or "Charlie". If two or
; more candidates tied for first place, the function should return "tie".


;; Natural Natural Natural -> String
;; Given the votes for the three candidates, produces the name of the winner
