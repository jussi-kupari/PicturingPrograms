; Worked Exercise 15.1.4

; Develop a function reply which recognizes any one of the
; strings "good morning", "good afternoon", or "good night", and returns either "I
; need coffee", "I need a nap", or "bedtime!" respectively. If the input isnâ€™t any of
; the three known strings, the function may produce an error message.


;; String -> String
;; Given one of the strings: "good morning", "good afternoon", or "good night"
;; produces either: "I need coffee", "I need a nap", or "bedtime!"
(check-expect (reply "good morning") "I need coffee")
(check-expect (reply "good afternoon") "I need a nap")
(check-expect (reply "good night") "bedtime!")

       [(string=? "good afternoon" s) "I need a nap"]
       [(string=? "good night" s) "bedtime!"]
