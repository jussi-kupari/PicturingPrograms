; Exercise 15.5.1
; A carpet store needs a function to compute how much to charge its
; customers. Carpeting costs $5/yard, but if you buy 100 yards or more,
; thereâ€™s a 10% discount on the whole order, and if you buy 500 yards
; or more, the discount becomes 20% on the whole order.
; 
; Develop a function carpet-price that takes in the number of yards
; of carpeting and returns its total price.


;; Natural -> Number
;; Given the lenght of carpet bought in full yards
;; produces the price after possible discount
