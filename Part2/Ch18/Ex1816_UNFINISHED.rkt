;Exercise 18.1.6
;Modify exercise 18.1.1 so that rather than adding a pure-red dot, it adds a drop of red dye at the mouse location. The dye adds a certain amount to the red component of the picture, varying with distance from where it was dropped: for example, if it added 100 to the red component right at the mouse location, it might add 50 to the neighboring pixels, 33 to the pixels 2 units away, 25 to the pixels 3 units away, and so on. The green and blue components of the picture should be unchanged. Hint: Use map3-image.
