; Exercise 21.7.5
; Write an animation in which a particular (small) picture moves with the mouse
; over a (large) background picture, and every time the user clicks and releases
; the mouse button, the small picture is added to the background picture at that
; location. For example, if the small picture were a smiley-face, you could place
; a bunch of smiley-faces in various places around the background picture, with a
; smiley-face always moving with the mouse so you can see what itâ€™ll look like in
; advance.
;

; Example of outcome:
