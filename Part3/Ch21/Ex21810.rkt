; Exercise 21.8.10
; Develop a function range? on vehicles. It should take in the num-
; ber of hours youâ€™re willing to travel, and will return how far you can go in that much time
; on this vehicle.

;; -- Data Definitions

;; Vehicle is one of:
;; - automobile
;; - bicycle
;; - train

(define-struct automobile (weight topspeed hp mpg))
;; Automobile is (make-automobile (Number Number Number Number))
;; interp. a car with weight top-speed, horsepower and fuel-economy

(define-struct bicycle (weight topspeed gears))
;; Bicycle is (make-bicycle (Number Number Natural))
;; interp. a bicycle with weight top-speed and number of gears

(define-struct train (weight topspeed length))
;; Train is (make-train (Number Number Number))
;; interp. a train with weight top-speed and length

;; -- Functions

;; range? : Vehicle Number -> Number
;; Given a vehicle and number of hours, produces the distance traveled
