; Exercise 21.4.2
; Choose a function youâ€™ve already written that operates on posn, and
; rewrite it to operate on a my-posn instead.


; Worked Exercise 20.6.1
; Write an animation of a picture that moves up, down, left,
; and right in response to the "up", "down", "left", and "right" arrow keys.
; It should ignore all other keys.
