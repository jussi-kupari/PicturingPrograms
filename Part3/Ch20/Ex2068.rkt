; Exercise 20.6.8
; Modify Exercise 20.6.1 so that in addition to responding to arrow
; keys, the dot moves slowly and randomly around the screen every half second: with equal
; probability, it moves up one pixel, down one pixel, left one pixel, or right one pixel.
; 
; Hint: Youâ€™ll obviously need to use random. Since all four random choices result in
; adding something to the current posn, you could write a helper function choose-offset
; that takes in a number (either 0, 1, 2, or 3) and returns the appropriate posn to add.
; Alternatively, you could write a function random-offset that takes in a dummy parameter,
; ignores it, picks a random number (either 0, 1, 2, or 3), and returns the appropriate
; posn to add. The latter approach is easier to use, but harder to test.
