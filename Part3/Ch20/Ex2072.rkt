; Exercise 20.7.2
; Write an animation that displays a large disk whose color changes
; with the clock and the mouse position: the x coordinate of the mouse should control the
; amount of red, the y coordinate should control the amount of blue, and the clock should
; control the amount of green.
; 
; Hint: As in Section 7.8.3, use min to make sure you never pass numbers larger than
; 255 to make-color.
; Thereâ€™s a built-in function color? which tells whether something is a color, and a
; built-in function color=? which tells whether two colors are the same.
