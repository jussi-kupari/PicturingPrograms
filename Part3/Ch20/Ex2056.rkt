; Exercise 20.5.6
; Redefine the distance function from Exercise 20.4.5 to be much shorter
; and simpler, by re-using functions youâ€™ve already seen or written in this chapter.
; Hint: You should be able to do this in two fairly short lines of Racket code.

; ; Exercise 20.4.5
; ; Develop a function named distance that takes in two posns
; ; (call them here and there), and computes the straight-line
; ; distance between them.
; ; 
; ; The formula is: 
; ; .
; ; 
; 
; 
; ;; distance : Posn Posn -> Number
; ;; Given two positions, produces the distance between the positions
; (check-expect (distance (make-posn 0 0) (make-posn 0 0)) 0)
; (check-within (distance (make-posn 10 10) (make-posn -50 -40)) 78 0.15)
