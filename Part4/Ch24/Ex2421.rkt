#|Exercise 24.2.1
Develop a function add-up-from-10 that takes in a whole number n â‰¥ 10 and returns
the sum 10 + 11 + . . . + n. Generalize this to a function add-up-between that takes
in two whole numbers m and n and returns the sum m + (m + 1) + . . . + n.|#

;; Given a Natural[10, ], produces the sum of all Naturals up from 10 to specified number
