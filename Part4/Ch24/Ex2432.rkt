#|Exercise 24.3.2
Develop a function wn-mult which multiplies two whole numbers
together without using any built-in arithmetic operators except add1, sub1, zero?, and
positive?. You are allowed to use wn-add, because itâ€™s not built-in; we just defined it
from these operators.|#

;; Given two naural numbers, produces their sum
(check-expect (wn-add 0 0) 0)
