#|Exercise 24.3.10
Develop a function frac=? that takes in two frac objects and tells
whether theyâ€™re equal.

Careful! What does it mean for two fractions to be equal?

Answer:
We can use the cross-products of the fractions to test for equality.
Cross-products of two equal fractions should produce equal numbers.
