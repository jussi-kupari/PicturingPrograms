#|Exercise 25.4.1
Develop a function cart-prod (short for “Cartesian product”) that
takes in two lists and returns a list of two-element lists, each with an
element from the first input list and an element from the second in that order.
The result should include all possible pairs of elements. You may assume that
there are no duplicate elements in the first list, and no duplicate elements
in the second list (although there might be things that are in both input lists.)

Hint: You’ll need a helper function.

Note: I am using strings here.|#

;; -- Data Definitions

;; List-of-String (LOS) is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons String LOS)
;; interp. a list of strings

;; List-of-LOS (LOLOS) is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons LOS LOLOS)
;; interp. a list of List-of-Strings



;; -- Functions

;; cart-prod : LOS LOS -> LOLOS
;; Given two List-of-Strings, produces a list of lists
;; that together produce all possible pairs from the elements of the two lists
