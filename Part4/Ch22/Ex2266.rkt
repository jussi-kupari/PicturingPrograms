; Exercise 22.6.6
; Develop a function winner that takes in a list of candidate structures and returns the one
; with the most votes. If there are two or more tied for first place,
; you can return whichever one you wish.
; 
; Hint: This doesnâ€™t have a reasonable answer if there are no candidates. How do you
; want to handle this case?
