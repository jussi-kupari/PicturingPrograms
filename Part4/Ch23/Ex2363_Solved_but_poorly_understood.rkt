#|Exercise 23.6.3 Develop a function subsets that takes in a list (of numbers, strings,
it doesnâ€™t matter) and returns a list of lists representing all possible subsets of the elements
in the original list, once each. For example, (subsets (list "a" "b" "c")) should
produce something like:

(list (list)
(list "a")
(list "b")
(list "a" "b")
(list "c")
(list "a" "c")
(list "b" "c")
(list "a" "b" "c"))
You may assume that all the things in the input list are different.

I wasn't able to get to the solution on my own. I just could not figure out the recursive algo.
The author of the book doesn't really give any help with these harder problems.
"Just do it one step at the time"... Sure, that reads just "Now draw the rest of the f*cking owl"
 
Luckily I found the answer here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20622945/how-to-do-a-powerset-in-drracket

I can understand it now, but implementing it on my own was too much without any help.
