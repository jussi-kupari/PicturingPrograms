#|Exercise 23.6.4
Develop a function scramble that takes in a list (of numbers, strings,
it doesnâ€™t matter) and returns a list of lists representing all possible orderings of the el-
ements in the original list, once each. For example, (scramble (list "a" "b" "c" ))
should produce something like
(list (list "a" "b" "c")
(list "b" "a" "c")
(list "a" "c" "b")
(list "c" "a" "b")
(list "b" "c" "a")
(list "c" "b" "a"))
Again, you may assume that all the things in the input list are different. Even better,
decide what the function should do if there are duplicate elements in the input list, and
make sure it does the right thing.
Hint: This will probably require more than one helper function. Take it one step at
a time: try to write the main function, figure out what you need to do to the recursive
result, invent a function to do that, and repeat until what you need to do is built-in.|#
