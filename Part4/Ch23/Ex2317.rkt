; Exercise 23.1.7
; Develop a function list-each that takes in a list (of numbers, strings, it doesnâ€™t matter)
; and returns a list of one-element lists, each containing a different one of the elements in
; the original list. For example,
; 
; (check-expect (list-each (cons "a" (cons "b" empty)))
; (cons (cons "a" empty) (cons (cons "b" empty) empty)))

;; Given a list-of-objects, produces the list with each element in its own list.
