; Practice Exercise 23.3.3
; For each exercise from Chapters 22 and 23 that youâ€™ve already done, rewrite the test cases
; using list or quasiquote notation, and try the function again. The results should be especially
; nice for functions that take in or return lists of lists or lists of structs,
; like Exercises 22.8.5 and 23.1.8.
