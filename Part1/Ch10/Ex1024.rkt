; Exercise 10.2.4
; Develop an animation that displays a digital counter, in 18-point
; blue numerals. It should start at 0 and increase by 1 each second.
; Hint: Since the change every second is a numeric change you should
; usea number as the model. But to display it on the screen, youâ€™ll
; need to turn the number into an image.
; 
; Have you written a function
; that does this?
