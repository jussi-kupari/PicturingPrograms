; Exercise 6.5.5
; Develop an animation in which a stick-figure stands at the edge of a
; lake (part of the background scene) and does slow cartwheels
; (say, 5 degrees every 1/10 second). The figureâ€™s reflection
; should appear below him in the lake, upside down and doing
; slow cartwheels in the opposite direction
; ( i.e. if the stick figure is rotating clockwise, the
; reflection should be rotating counter-clockwise).
