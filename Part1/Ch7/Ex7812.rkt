; Exercise 7.8.12
; Define a function apply-blue-gradient that takes in an image and returns an image
; with the same red and green components, but with the blue component equal to
; the y coordinate (so none at the top and the most at the bottom).
; 
; Hint: Test your program with images of a variety of sizes, including some that
; are more than 255 pixels high. (It would be nice to have this function always
; reach full blue just at the bottom of the image, regardless of image height, but
; that requires some techniques you donâ€™t know yet; weâ€™ll see how in Chapters 27 and 28.)
