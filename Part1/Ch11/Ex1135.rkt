; Exercise 11.3.5
; The nation of Progressiva has a simple tax code. The tax you
; pay is your salary times the tax rate, and the tax rate is 0.5%
; per thousand dollars of salary. For example, if you make $40,000,
; your tax rate is 0.5% times 40, which is 20%, so you pay 20%
; of $40,000, which is $8,000. Develop a function to compute the
; net pay (i.e. pay after taxes) of a person with a given salary.
; 
; Hint: Youâ€™ll probably need two auxiliary functions as well as net-pay.


;; Number(salary) -> Number(net pay)
;; Given salary, produces net-pay
(check-expect (get-net-pay 40000) 32000)
(define (get-net-pay s)
  (- s (* s (/ (get-tax-rate s) 100))))


;; Number(gross-pay) -> Number(tax-rate)
;; given gross-pay, produces tax-rate
(check-expect (get-tax-rate 40000) 20)

(define (get-tax-rate s)
  (* (/ s 1000) 0.5))

; Exercise 11.3.6
; This tax system has the peculiar feature that, beyond a certain
; income level, if you earn more, you actually get less take-home pay.
; Use your net-pay function to find this income level by experimentation.
; Now imagine the tax rate rises to 0.6% per thousand dollars of salary.
; What would you need to modify in the program to handle this change?
; What would be the new income level beyond which you get less take-home pay?
; 
; ------------------------------
; 
; default point is at 100,000
; 
; at 0.6% it is at 82,000
